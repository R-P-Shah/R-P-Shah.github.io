If Tom produced just 1 phone that quarter, he would need to sell it at a little over $20. If the price is less than that, then there is no incentive to produce any product. A price below $20 would put the supply curve into the negative, and a negative supply is not feasible. Thus, the minimum price is $20 for Tom to enter the market."
