        <h1>The Power Rule: Prelearning</h1>

        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>Given a monomial expression, the student can apply the Power Rule to determine the derivative of the monomial correctly - with accurate  coefficients and powers - in at least 2 out of 3 derivative problems.</p>

        <p>Recall the formal definition of the derivative that you have already learned. It is shown below. Under that is the definition of the power rule. The power rule is a fast way of calculating the derivative. Look at the flowchart and the defintiion of the power rule before moving on to learning the next module.</p>
