        <p>What I love about UX is the ability to solve problems and help people. I am all about listening to users and coming up with solutions, and I love thinking outside-the box. My favorite parts of the UX design process are user interviews, usability testing, and wireframing because I love working on usability and aspects of layout, flow, and ease of use. I might not be as tech savvy as a developer, or as aesthetic as a graphic designer, but I fill an important niche that bridges the gap between users and products. I work best in dyamic groups jumping from one project to the next, always on my toes ready to take on new challenges.



        </p> <p>Iâ€™m currently pursuing two minors on top of my degree: Psychology and American Sign Language. Iâ€™m concentrating in Instructional Technology and Museum Exhibit Design. Iâ€™m President of the User Experience Club at RIT. I love baking, 3D modeling, canoeing, and Iâ€™m a musician.</p>
